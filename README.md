In this project, I will propose a monitoring solution for Telecom services based on CDRs.
CDRs or otherwise call detail records to hold specific information for traffic such as **VoIP, Data, SMS**. 

This event-driven solution could be used to monitor network service status proactively. 
We expect that at any given point, a specific data type should fall under particular values. 
For instance, **VoIP Established session 99%, Max Jitter: 30ms, packet loss at any given time should be <1 %**.  
We can't expect the same traffic pattern at 23:00 or 10:00. The state of the network services is a sum based on a cumulative formula. These are "datapoint/point-features." Will focus on:

* EPC SMS/DATA Traffic
* VoIP Traffic 

### Architecture Design

We use Elastic stack components to set up the infrastructure. Each component executes a specific task below we can see a breakdown.

The stack is deployed based on 'deployment.yml' file. Within this file, we define each **service, number of replicas, failure scenario, ports, volumes, etc**.

Component | Description
---|---|
Filebeat | lightweight process that ships log data
Logstash | Aggregation/Mediation layer
Elasticsearch | Nosql DB/Backend where we store the data
Kibana | Web gui

Based on a small data sample I created a bigger dataset.

* I used [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/) learn library for data creation.
* Data will trend based on regular daily traffic with an expect increased till mid-day.
* We can use data_sample.csv for datapoints.
